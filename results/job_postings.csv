4133970635,42403898.0,Prompt Engineer,"Hi, we're The Browser Company 👋 and we're building a better way to use the internet.

Browsers are unique in that they are one of the only pieces of software that you share with your parents as well as your kids. Which makes sense, they're our doorway to the most important things — through them we socialize with loved ones, work on our passion projects, and explore our curiosities. But on their own, they don’t actually do a whole lot, they’re kind of just there. They don’t help us organize our messy lives or make it easier to compose our ideas. We believe that the browser could do so much more — it can empower and support the amazing things we do on the internet. That’s why we’re building one: a browser that can help us grow, create, and stay curious.

To accomplish this lofty task, we’re building a diverse team of people from different backgrounds and experiences. This isn’t optional, it’s crucial to our mission, as we need a wide range of perspectives to challenge our assumptions and shape our browser through a bold, creative lens. With that in mind, we especially encourage women, people of color, and others from historically marginalized groups to apply.

A strong interest in staying up-to-date with the latest developments in AI and LLM technologies, particularly how they can be applied to real-world products. Ability to translate product direction and requirements into effective prompts that deliver on user needs. 

Compensation And Benefits

This is a 3-month contract-to-hire position. Hourly pay range is $70–100 per hour, based on experience and qualifications.
